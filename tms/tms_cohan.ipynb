    "# Introduction to TMS and Motor Thresholds \n",
    "\n",
    "Authored by Remy Cohan [cohanR.github.io] with minor edits - mostly formatting - by Peter Kohler [kohlerlab.com].\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed during the lecture and as you saw in the video we played during class (also available on eClass), in TMS research, we often measure motor thresholds (MTs) using single-pulse TMS to primary motor cortex (M1). The resting motor threshold (rMT) is defined as the minimum TMS intensity that produces an electromyographic (EMG) response of 50 ÂµV in a relaxed muscle. MTs are an important measure because they can reflect changes in neural excitability and plasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, repetitive TMS (rTMS) is a different technique where multiple pulses are delivered in patterns (e.g., 1 Hz, 10 Hz, or theta burst stimulation). rTMS is gaining popularity as a potential treatment for neuropsychiatric conditions and in neurorehabilitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To study the effects of rTMS, we can measure MTs using single-pulse TMS before and after an rTMS protocol. This allows us to see how the rTMS protocol changes neural activity in a specific brain area, which is critical when designing treatment protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the distinction:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single-pulse TMS: Measures MTs and neural excitability in primary motor cortex (M1).\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Repetitive TMS (rTMS): Modulates neural activity to induce plasticity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In the data below, pre-rTMS refers to a baseline single-pulse TMS measure of MTs before the rTMS protocol. Post-rTMS refers to the same measure after the rTMS protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "This background should help you interpret the data and answer the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is a good idea to review some of Panda's functions such as groupby and .agg here:** https://github.com/marsja/jupyter/blob/master/pandas_groupby_tutorial.ipynb"
