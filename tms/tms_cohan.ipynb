    "Introduction to TMS and Motor Thresholds (Remy Cohan; CohanR.Github.io)\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier and you saw in the video, in TMS research, we often measure motor thresholds (MTs) using single-pulse TMS to primary motor cortex (M1). The resting motor threshold (rMT) is defined as the minimum TMS intensity that produces an electromyographic (EMG) response of 50 ÂµV in a relaxed muscle. MTs are an important measure because they can reflect changes in neural excitability and plasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, repetitive TMS (rTMS) is a different technique where multiple pulses are delivered in patterns (e.g., 1 Hz, 10 Hz, or theta burst stimulation). rTMS is gaining popularity as a potential treatment for neuropsychiatric conditions and in neurorehabilitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To study the effects of rTMS, we can measure MTs using single-pulse TMS before and after an rTMS protocol. This allows us to see how the rTMS protocol changes neural activity in a specific brain area, which is critical when designing treatments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the distinction:\n",
